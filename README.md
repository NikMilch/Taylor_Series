What is function aproximation
Function approximation is applied in mathematical and computer science, because some of the functions are difficult or impossible to be calculate - for example sin, cos, ln. Approximation theory describes how functions can be best approximate with simpler functions. The purpose is approximation to be done as close as possible to the actual function. On the computer or on the calculator approximation is typically done with polynomials or rational approximation using operation addition and multiplication. Close approximation can be reached by using high degree polynomial or narrowing the domain that polynomial has to approximate the function.
